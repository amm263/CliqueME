This was a project in C for a final.
I had to implement a known algorithm (Bron–Kerbosch) to find the maximal clique in an undirected graph.
I preferred to invent a personal algorithm to find an approximate solution.
Its name is CliqueME, stands for Clique Maximal Enough and it's...not so good as it supposed to be, but mistakes are always useful to learn new things.

I have not translated the code, but you can find the pseudo code and an example of working in the documentation. 
Enjoy it.
